# DevOps
This section includes the DevOps details of Polaris.

We have not deployed Polaris on a proper infrastructure yet. We will add details later so check this section again!

However, you can deploy the web version of the app yourself. After running the command `npm run build:web`, the `web-build` folder includes everything you need to deploy a web app. Services like [Netlify] or Zeit's [Now] can also help you.
